## Schema

_Pydantic_ allows auto creation of JSON Schemas from models.

The generated schemas are compliant with the specifications: `JSON Schema Core`, `JSON Schema Validation` and `OpenAPI`.

`BaseModel.schema` will return a dict of the schema, while `BaseModel.schema_json` will return a JSON string representation of that dict.

Sub-models used are added to the `definitions` JSON attribute and referenced, as per the spec.

All sub-models' (and their sub-models') schemas are put directly in a top-level `definitions` JSON key for easy re-use and reference.

"Sub-models" with modifications (via the `Field` class) like a custom title, description or default value, are recursively included instead of referenced.

The `description` for models is taken from either the docstring of the class or the argument `description` to the `Field` class.

The schema is generated by default using aliases as keys, but it can be generated using model property names instead by calling `MainModel.schema/schema_json(by_alias=False)`.

The format of `$ref`s (`"#/definitions/FooBar"` above) can be altered by calling `schema()` or `schema_json()` with the `ref_template` keyword argument, e.g. `ApplePie.schema(ref_template='/schemas/{model}.json#/')`, here `{model}` will be replaced with the model naming using `str.format()`.
