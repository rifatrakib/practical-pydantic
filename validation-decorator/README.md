## Validation decorator

The `validate_arguments` decorator allows the arguments passed to a function to be parsed and validated using the function's annotations before the function is called. While under the hood this uses the same approach of model creation and initialisation; it provides an extremely easy way to apply validation to your code with minimal boilerplate.
